\section{March Of The Water People}

This we swear upon our lives or even death:\\
That we will not drink at all\\
that devilish alcohol.\\
You may join us and check every single breath\\
but you'll see our edge is straight.

Hooray, us jolly water drinkers.\\
Alcohol won't make us weary,\\
we are always feeling cheery.\\
Hooray, us sober water drinkers.\\
We're as fresh as one can be.

When you live your life in peaceful harmony,\\
read and study all day long,\\
never partake in beer pong,\\
stay away from ill-behaving company,\\
what a bliss it all can be!

Hooray, us jolly water drinkers ...

Karma surely punishes all sinful deeds.\\
Those that other always,\\
when they drink their heads cuckoo.\\
It can ruin heritage and dynasties\\
and collapse the whole culture*.

Hooray, us jolly water drinkers ...

\textit{*In a sophisticated manner.}
