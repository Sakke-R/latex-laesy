\section{Ethanol Tetris}

\textit{Melody: Tetris theme}

Race to the bottom line, vodka in hand I am-\\
Setting down some champagne too\\
Clearing lines with our primo-beer then the\\
Whiskey comes to sober us

Packing some punch, the procentual kind I am-\\
ravaging my liver now\\
Leading way I am filled to brim as\\
My throat is filled with gambina

Cider and long drink, j√§ger and bitter I-\\
empty all of the JALLU\\
Cramming rum to fill that lung-gap\\
Gin-zipping every row from there

Compressing cognacs, red and white wines\\
Fernet branca for my friend\\
Glowing wine or porter fine\\
The cognac's floating on vodka

Live in an Absinthe haze, moonshine refined I\\
swim, and deliver my booze\\
Intoxication, doubling down on it\\
alcohol is still flowing

Choking up, messing up, dropped my drinks on the floor\\
Just a few more then I'm down\\
'tensely battling it, quickly sipping at\\
I am sure I can down this\\
