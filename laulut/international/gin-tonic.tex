\textit{Melody: Pokémon Theme}

It's starting to vex me now\\
that lukewarm beer I had.\\
A new phase I see now\\
gluten free at that!\\
As in years of my youth\\
I won't have a Heineken\\
A drink clear is what I choose,\\
shelve that I.P.A.!

Gin Tonic - as my drink tonight!\\
Though a beer'd be cheaper!\\
Gin Tonic - you are my choice\\
each drunk and hazy night!\\
Gin Tonic - (as my drink tonight) - It's you and me\\
when I get to sip at you!\\
Kyrö, Hendrick's, Beefeater!\\
Gin Tonic!\\
As my drink tonight, as my drink tonight - Gin Tonic!
