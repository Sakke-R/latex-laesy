\section{Screamin' Vomit}

\textit{Melody: Cicapo}

I drink a little booze and then I throw up, throw up.\\
Crawling to the bathroom, there I throw up, throw up.

Screamin' vomit, screamin' vomit\\
Throw up, throw up\\
A puke is flying high.

Now I am feeling sick, my stomach feels so weird\\
I think I'm gonna go cast out a corner rune.\\
A moment of relief, surely life will triumph.\\
Fuck, guess I spoke too soon! Goddamn, I'm coming through!

I drink a little booze...
