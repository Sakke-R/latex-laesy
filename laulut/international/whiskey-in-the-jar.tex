\section{Whiskey in the Jar}

As I was a goin' over\\
the far famed Kerry mountains\\
I met with captain Farrell\\
and his money he was counting\\
I first produced my pistol\\
and I then produced my rapier\\
Saying "Stand and deliver"\\
for he were a bold deceiver

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da\\
Whack fall the daddy-o, whack fall the daddy-o\\
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money\\
and it made a pretty penny\\
I put it in me pocket\\
and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore\\
that she never would deceive me\\
But the devil take the women\\
for they never can be easy

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da...

I went unto my chamber,\\
all for to take a slumber\\
I dreamt of gold and jewels\\
and for sure it was no wonder\\
But Jenny drew me charges\\
and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell\\
to be ready for the slaughter
