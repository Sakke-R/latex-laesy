\section{The Third Water Song}

\textit{Melody: La donna Ã¨ mobile}

Drink up your water glass.\\
It just might save your ass.\\
You'll remain healthy\\
and won't feel guilty.\\
Water is plentiful\\
fresh and delectable.\\
No getting wasted,\\
clumsy or plastered.

I'm feeling sober.\\
Not tripping over.\\
On the next day -\\
Feeling fresh and great.
