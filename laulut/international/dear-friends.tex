\section{Dear Friends}
My dear friends our grand feast will begin here\\
Our glasses we raise with a wild cheer\\
:,: But tonight we won't drink any light beer\\
Just champagne will put us in the mood :,:

All night drinks down our throats we'll be pouring\\
We'll remember good times, not the boring\\
:,: Through the ceiling our song will be soaring\\
Finnish spirits are better than good :,:

When friends drink too much with one another\\
They make new memories more than rather\\
:,: You can trust everyone like your brother\\
We won't run out of drinks maybe food :,:
