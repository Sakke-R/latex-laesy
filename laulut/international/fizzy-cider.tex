\section{Fizzy Cider}
\textit{Melody: Bob the Builder}

Fizzy cider, CAN WE DRINK IT?\\
Fizzy cider, YES WE CAN!

Students all know it and fuksis too,\\
cider is cheap but tastes like glue.\\
After your taste buds have gone numb,\\
drinking more cider ain't that dumb!

Fizzy cider, CAN WE DRINK IT?\\
Fizzy cider, YES WE CAN??
