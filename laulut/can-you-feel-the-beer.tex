\section{Can you feel the beer tonight}
You’re yet empty handed,\\
the eve is sober still.\\
But when I arrive from the Alepa\\
a case I’ll bring for thrill.\\
As we take the first drinks\\
which we quite enjoyed,\\
then through the night we one by one\\
have them all destroyed.\\

:,: And can you feel\\
the beer tonight,\\
the fine taste of hops?\\
Drink it all\\
for it is our golden haul;\\
the beer-flow never stops. :,:
