\section{Gimme, gimme, gimme a glass at the sitsit}
One more drink\\
I’ll be watching the sitsit on my seat, head buzzing\\
How I hate to spend the party mind blown out

Kossu shot\\
Pouring into my shot glass as I look around for saviour\\
And it makes me so sickly to sip my drink

There’s not a drop out there\\
Nowhere to get water

Gimme, gimme, gimme a glass at the sitsit\\
Won’t somebody give me glass of aqua today\\
Gimme, gimme, gimme a glass at the sitsit\\
Take me to the kitchen to wash my thirst away

Clock it down\\
Give me all of the water with a beaker to fill\\
I’m so thirsty I could jug two-litre bin

Every drop\\
I will lick it all dry and I gaze into the glass\\
But there’s nothing there to see, no more in sight

There’s not a drop out there\\
Nowhere to get water

Gimme, gimme, gimme a glass at the sitsit\\
Won’t somebody give me glass of aqua today\\
Gimme gimme gimme a glass at the sitsit\\
Take me to the kitchen to wash my thirst away
